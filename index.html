		<h4><em>
			A story about tabs vs spaces, and how you can improve
			the world by using tabs.
		</em></h4>

		<p>
			As programmers, we have all been exposed to the problem
			of different styles of indentation. You might prefer
			using tabs for indentation, but others might prefer
			spaces. If we are not constistent with the character
			used for indentation, we end up with a mess of mixed
			spaces and tabs. As a result, our code will be very hard
			to read, since it might display differently on different
			systems or editors.
			<br>
			Though most of the reasons for choosing one indentation
			style over another are of aesthetic concerns, many
			people don't realise that they might be giving up on
			semantic meaning and accessibility for others.
		</p>

		<h2>ASCII entry #9: Horizontal Tab</h2>

		<p>
			Back in the old days, when FORTRAN and ALGOL were the
			new craze, tabs were the standard way to indent code.
			The ASCII character set has a horizontal tab, which is
			a <em>control</em> character. Control characters differ
			from graphical characters, because they command the
			computer to perform a certain action instead of simply
			rendering a letter or a symbol on the screen.
			<br>
			The tab character instructs the computer to move the
			cursor to the next tab stop. On the other hand, spaces
			are a <em>graphical</em> character, and simply render
			whitespace on the screen. As a result, using the tab
			character to indent source code provides a semantically
			better meaning than a space. Tabs are single characters
			that indicate a <em>disjunction</em> between two parts
			of a program. Because they are inserted at the very
			beginning of the lines of code, tabs will consistently
			render nested blocks of indention at their own assigned
			tab stop.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>Spaces: those things that seperate words</h2>

		<p>
			Spaces have been around for a long time. They are
			essential in making natural language readable, because
			they seperate words. These ingenious characters are also
			present in programming languages, where they seperate
			tokens. Without them, code would be hard to read. Most
			compilers and interpreters require us to seperate
			certain types of tokens, such as identifiers and
			numbers. If we didn't, the compiler would not be able
			to understand the code correctly.
			<br>
			Thus, spaces are crucial to express code clearly and
			unambiguously. They are, however, <em>not</em> meant to
			be used for indentation. The sole purpose of spaces is
			to seperate words, not to define layers of indention.
			If spaces are used both for indentation and for
			seperating words, spaces themselves become an ambiguous
			character.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>So why do people use spaces then?</h2>

		<p>
			That is a very good question. Probably because most IDEs
			default to using spaces for indentation. To understand
			why this happened, we will go back into the past. Back
			in 1969, when UNIX was being developed and ASCII was
			standardised by RFC #20, tabs stops became a customary.
			Just like typewriters, hitting the tab key on a keyboard
			would move the cursor to the next tab stop. In UNIX, tab
			stops are laid out on a multiple of 8 characters.
			<br><br>
			When the devil felt like bringing terror to the world
			and Windows was first released in 1985, things changed.
			Windows used a tab stop of 4 characters, which caused
			utter hysteria among programmers. Tabs were no longer
			constistent among major operating systems. What's worse
			is that people kind of started to like four character
			indentation. Because of the consistency issues, some
			pretentious fool came with the idea of using spaces for
			indentation instead. They would be consistent for
			everyone on all operating systems, after all. Right?
			<br><br>
			Well, back in the day, people weren't gifted with 32
			Gigabytes of RAM and a 64-core processor. Using four
			individual space characters instead of a single tab
			character was causing a lot of unneeded redundancy.
			<br>
			The lovely developers who did not like this new trend
			realised that all of this mess could be solved with just
			some simple software. Editors can simply let the user
			decide what tab width they want to use, and the editor
			will display the code exactly like they want it to be,
			but still with a tab character for superior semantic
			meaning.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>The apocalypse</h2>

		<p>
			In spite of the attempt to stop the hype of using spaces
			for indentation, people started massively abandoning the
			beloved tab character, and spaces quickly became the
			norm. When programmers found out that using four spaces
			allowed them to write more levels of indentation without
			the feeling of lack of space, they became even lazier.
			Experienced programmers became obsessed with using many
			levels of indentation, and some of them even started
			using <em>two</em> spaces instead of four, to allow them
			to use <em>even more</em> levels of indentation.
			<br><br>
			Linus Torvalds warned us, but it was too late:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			"Now, some people will claim that having 8-character
			indentations makes the code move too far to the right,
			and makes it hard to read on a 80-character terminal
			screen. The answer to that is that if you need more than
			3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and
			should fix your program."
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			The script kiddies with their new constricting snakes,
			red shiny stones and Indonesian islands that ran on the
			web, did not care, however. The more layers of nested
			indentation, the faster their scripts would hack into
			the mainframes of the CIA.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>Aestethics vs accessibility</h2>

		<p>
			Spaces have a graphical meaning. We are essentially
			making a visual drawing of the code, where every letter
			is laid out on a specific position on the screen. This
			contrasts with tabs, which solely provide a semantical
			meaning. Three tabs mean three layers of indention, but
			eight spaces does not have any meaning on its own.
			<br><br>
			The core difference is the visual vs semantic meaning.
			Spaces also restrict our freedom, because we are no
			longer able to set our own preferred tab width. Most
			people who choose to use spaces do this because of
			visually aesthetic reasons. However, they forget that
			not everyone might like their style of indentation, and
			that it might lead to serious readibility issues for
			visually impaired programmers. Around 3% of the world
			has moderately or severely impaired eyesight, which many
			programmers don't realise. These visually impaired
			programmers are often forced to set a very specific tab
			width to even be able to read code at all.
			<br><br>
			Meet Kevin, a lovely developer who has been happily
			working for a company for many years. He has been
			involved with the first couple of major projects, and
			has done tremendous amounts of work for the business.
			One of Kevin's coworkers, David, is working alone on a
			small experimental project for the company, and decides
			to be creative, and use spaces instead of the usual
			tabs. He knows Kevin well. David remembers him as a
			very friendly person, and respects him a lot because
			Kevin is moderately visually impaired, but he is still
			able to code, albeit with a huge font size, a crazy
			colour theme, and constant scrolling to the left and
			right of the screen.
			<br>
			The project David has been working on turns out to be
			a success, and more people start working on it. One day
			a major bug is discovered, and the programmers rush
			together to fix it. When Kevin reviews the code, he
			finds that David decided to use spaces instead of tabs,
			and the code is not readable at all on his editor.
			Kevin tells his coworkers that he cannot easily work
			with the code, and that he will focus on another
			project. Due to the heat of the moment and the severity
			of the bug, his remark is not received by his coworkers.
			<br><br>
			As more and more people start using David's program,
			it becomes one of the main objectives of the company.
			As Kevin is not actively involved in the project, his
			coworkers miss the fact that he cannot work with the
			code in an easy way. More projects are started, and
			they all use spaces instead of tabs. Kevin doesn't dare
			to speak up, because he feels that he is the only one
			that doesn't like spaces. Instead, he uses his IDE's
			tool to convert the spaces to tabs. The tool is a bit
			buggy though, as some of the spaces that are actually
			used as alignment are mistakenly seen as indentation
			instead, and because of the ambiguity of the spaces that
			are used as token seperators, indentation, and
			alignment, his tool cannot convert the code very well.
			Kevin has to manually delete tabs from the converted
			code that shouldn't be there, which is a pain for him.
			<br><br>
			Kevin becomes more fearful of speaking up about his
			problems with the code using spaces, because he thinks
			he will be seen as an obstacle who would ruin the new
			code style of the company. It's not the first time Kevin
			experiences this fear. Because he is burdened with his
			eyesight on a daily basis, Kevin naturally fears about
			being less productive than other, and even redundant.

		<h2>Public service announcement</h2>

		<p>
			If you have been using spaces all the time, just because
			it was your IDE's default, or for any other reason,
			please try out tabs one time and notice how it doesn't
			screw up your code at all. Using tabs works just as good
			visually with your IDE settings, but your code will be
			accessible to everyone!
			<br><br>
			<em>Care about the people around you? Use tabs!</em>
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>Sure, but ...</h2>

		<p>
			You might have some examples of code where you would
			think using spaces would be better, so I will show you
			some common arguments as to why spaces are better, and
			refute them with counterexamples.
		</p>

		<h3>The dreaded 80 column limit</h3>

		<p>
			Many programmers set a column limit of a certain number
			of characters for their source code. This is a good
			thing, because it ensures the reader doesn't have to
			scroll to the right, or lines fall off because they are
			too long. Since programmers set their own preferred tab
			width, people with smaller tab widths might write code
			that fits within <em>their</em> column limit, but
			someone with a bigger tab width might have lines exceed
			their column limit.
			<br>
			...
		</p>

		<h3>Aligning code</h3>

		<p>
			Some programmers really like aligning code. Using tabs
			for this just doesn't work, because you cannot do
			alignments on a character basis. The truth is that you
			should actually be using spaces for alignment!
			<br>
			Though some people really like aligning code like
			illustrated below, it is not a good idea if you care
			about accessibility. Alignment is a visual aid, and
			might be hard to read for visual impaired people. On top
			of that, it's just a pain for everyone to realign entire
			blocks of code after editing just one line. I reckon
			editor extensions should be used if the programmer
			really wants their code to be laid out in a particular
			way. Source code should not contain visual aids like
			alignment. Editors should be held responsible for this.
